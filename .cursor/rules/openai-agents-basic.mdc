# OpenAI Agents SDK - Basic Usage

## When to Use This Rule
Use this rule when you need to implement basic OpenAI agents functionality. This is appropriate when:
- Setting up a simple AI agent that provides text responses
- Understanding the fundamental concepts of the Agents SDK
- Creating a basic agent with minimal configuration
- Learning the basic execution flow for agents

## Creating and Running Agents

Basic structure for creating and running agents:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

# Create an agent with instructions
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant."
)

# Run the agent synchronously
async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Your query here")
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Components

- **Agent**: Defines behavior with instructions, name, and optional tools/handoffs
- **Runner**: Manages the execution of agents
- **run/run_sync**: Methods to execute agents (async/sync)

## Basic Agent Parameters

- `name`: Identifier for the agent
- `instructions`: Behavior guidance for the agent 
- `tools`: List of tools the agent can use
- `handoffs`: List of agents this agent can transfer control to
- `model`: Model to use (default is GPT-4)
- `output_type`: Expected return type for structured outputs

## Agent Execution Loop

1. Agent receives input
2. LLM generates response (may include tool calls)
3. If response has final output, loop ends
4. If response has handoff, control transfers to new agent
5. If response has tool calls, tools execute and loop continues

## Example: Hello World

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        instructions="You only respond in haikus."
    )
    
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me about recursion in programming.")
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Environment Setup

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running agents.
