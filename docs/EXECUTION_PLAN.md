# AgentGUI - Project Execution Plan

## Project Brief
AgentGUI is a visual interface built on tldraw for managing and monitoring OpenAI Agents. It provides real-time visualization of agent workflows, states, and interactions, allowing users to:

- tldraw latest version
- OpenAI Agents SDK

### Key Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "tldraw": "latest",
    "@tldraw/core": "latest",
    "openai-agents": "^0.1.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "zustand": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",

## Progress Tracking

Each stage should be marked as:
- [ ] Not Started
- [/] In Progress
- [x] Completed

## Success Criteria
1. Agents can be visualized and managed through the GUI
2. Real-time status updates are reflected immediately
3. Workflows can be created and modified visually
4. Agent configurations can be modified through the interface
5. System performs well with 20+ agents
6. All critical operations have error handling
7. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Risk Management
- Performance degradation with many agents
- Real-time update synchronization issues
